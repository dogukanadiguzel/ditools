		<h1>Innovation Assessments Tools</h1>
		<p>D&I Researcher provides a self-assessment using the drop menus (click on an answer cell, and then the little down arrow box to the right of the cell to see answers) in the "D&I Researcher's Assessment" tab</p>
		<p>After reading this readme, click on the green "Applicant Assessment" tab below to see the questions</p>
		<p>D&I and I&E researchers have come up with an initial set of questions listed under the "QUESTIONS" tab; other questions can be added to this list at any time.</p>

		<p>Reviewers 1 through 3 do the same, using the drop menus in the "Reviewer Assessment" tabs</p>
		<p>An "overall innovation viability score" is assigned, based on the variance between the researcher's assessment and those of the reviewers under the "Overall Score" tab</p>
		<p>Designed to calculate the variance between a Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) researcher's assessment of the value of an innovation against the assessment of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) subject matter experts</p>
		<p>No jargon terminology is used in this version; it is assumed that D&I researchers are not yet intimately familiar with I&E terminology</p>
		<p>No detailed market research is required at this stage; it is assumed that the D&I researcher has some familiarity with the market forces likely to impact the dissemination and implementation of the innovation</p>
		<p>Currently limited to 15 questions and 3 reviewers; will be expandable in future versions</p>
